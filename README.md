### Hello, world! &nbsp; ðŸ‘‹

 > ðŸŒ± &nbsp; Since January 2020, I've been focused purely on Android apps, strengthening my skills with OOP, MVVM, asynchronous programming, and automated testing.
 > 
 > ðŸ‘¯ &nbsp; I am always open to new projects. I most enjoy organizing, testing, and optimizing code as well as data analysis and clean up.
 > 
 > ðŸ”­ &nbsp; My paid projects are not on public repos, so I try to create portfolio projects here to reference my skills and help others with common code patterns.
